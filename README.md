# PPL Theory

This project is a webapp to learn for the private pilot's licence theory test.

While learning for my private pilot's licence I didn't find any good app to learn the required questionnaire to pass the theory test. The public questionnaire consists of 75% of the full questionnaire, while the remaining 25% is not public. The public questionnaire can be downloaded as a PDF with the right answers already marked. I found it very time consuming to learn from a PDF while hiding the answers with a piece of paper so I dediced to build an app.
The app stores all the wrong answered questions in firestore so I could repeat only those questions instead of going all over the questionnaire.
The questions are in German & English.
